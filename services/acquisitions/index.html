          <p class="deal-content">In recent years we have advised a number of companies looking to grow and/or diversify
            their activities by acquiring other businesses.
          </p>
          <p class="deal-content">Examples of sectors in which we have assisted clients include air-conditioning (where
            we represented a global organisation in its search activities), steel fabrication, giftware and freight
            forwarding.

          </p>
          <p class="deal-content">In many instances we have undertaken an initial detailed research exercise to identify
            acquisition targets, always taking into consideration the preferred parameters of our clients.

          </p>
          <p class="deal-content">On other occasions we have simply worked with clients to approach specific targets
            identified by our clients.
