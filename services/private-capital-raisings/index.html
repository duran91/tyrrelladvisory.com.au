      <h1>Private Capital Raisings</h1>
      <p>Funding existing or future growth can often be a challenge for private businesses. Tyrrell Advisory assists
        owners in exploring alternative ways in which equity or hybrid capital can be raised from various networks,
        including private equity funds, high net worth families and individuals, retail brokerages and institutional
        investors.
      </p>
      <p>Tyrrell Advisory has relationships with many private equity firms and private investment groups who remain keen
        to identify and invest in strongly performing private businesses, many of whom are content to acquire minority
        stakes. We are always pleased to provide advice to owners as to the applicability of private equity for their
        business.
