    <p>Selling a business is not just about a transaction but about a journey that commences with us learning about our
      client’s business and then ensuring the business is appropriately prepared to maximise the outcome.
      If you are considering a sale of all or part of your business, we would be pleased to discuss with you the various
      stages involved in undertaking a sale process, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assessment of value</li>
      <li>Preferred sale strategy and approach to minimise completion risk</li>
      <li>Preparation of sale materials such as Information Memorandum and flyer</li>
      <li>Researching potential interested parties</li>
      <li>Contacting agreed parties</li>
      <li>Releasing information and arranging meetings</li>
      <li>Obtaining offers</li>
      <li>Managing the due diligence process</li>
      <li>Liaising and negotiating with short-listed parties</li>
      <li>Co-ordinating with our client’s other advisors</li>
      <li>Closing the transaction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It may be that the business requires additional time and preparation before it is ready to be taken to market –
      if so, Tyrrell Advisory will work with the owner to develop a program to prepare the business for sale.
    </p>
    <p>Examples of matters to consider in advance of a divestment include having financial statements audited,
      undertaking
      accounting policy and other compliance exercises, formalising contractual arrangements, diversifying customer
      bases,
      identifying and implementing profit improvement initiatives, locking in key executives and staff, and performing
      tax
      planning exercises. By completing such exercises, owners are far better placed to articulate the key strategies
      for
      success and develop plans to address any perceived weaknesses and threats to their business model.
    </p>
    <p>Through its established networks, Tyrrell Advisory has a strong knowledge of corporate acquirers and investors
      (be
      they high net worth families, private equity firms, retail brokerages or institutional investors). We are able to
      identify and approach potential partners and buyers (including overseas parties) that strategically align with the
      objectives of our clients.
