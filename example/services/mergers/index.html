    <p>Generally, many of the services required for mergers, joint ventures and strategic alliances will replicate those
      required for acquisitions. In such transactions Tyrrell Advisory will assist the business owners through the
      entire process providing high level strategy and planning advice, deal structuring, project management and
      transaction execution services and in conjunction with our clients liaise and negotiate with counterparties.
