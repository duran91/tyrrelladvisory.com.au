    <p>Generally, many of the services required for mergers, joint ventures and strategic alliances will replicate those
      required for acquisitions. In such transactions Tyrrell Advisory will assist the business owners through the
      entire process providing high level strategy and planning advice, deal structuring, project management and
      transaction execution services and in conjunction with our clients liaise and negotiate with counterparties.

          <p class="deal-title">Advised Citywide</p>
          <p class="deal-content">An example of our merger services was our engagement by Citywide (owned by City of Melbourne and chaired by Hon. Mr John Brumby, former Premier of Victoria). This engagement involved us seeking an investor to acquire a 50% equity stake in Citywideâ€™s asphalt manufacturing plant in North Melbourne and hence enter into a joint venture arrangement with this party moving forward.</p>
          <p class="deal-content">Due to its close proximity to Melbourne this asset/business attracted strong interest from a number of sizeable parties (including overseas owned groups). Pleasingly a deal was finalised with Fulton Hogan.</p>
          <p class="deal-content">In addition to agreeing a Sale Agreement, this transaction also involved finalising a Joint Venture Agreement, Property Lease Agreement, Raw Material Supply Agreement and Services Agreement.</p>
          <p class="deal-content">More specifically, we assisted Citywide throughout the duration of the transaction, including identifying, approaching and liaising with potential investors; preparing a detailed Information Memorandum; managing the electronic Data Room; obtaining and negotiating indicative and final offers; as well as working alongside Citywide and its legal adviser in finalising the various transaction agreements.</p>
          <p class="deal-content recommendation">"Thank you for the leadership and sound advice provided during our recent transaction. Your presence and guidance were appreciated throughout the process. Your expertise greatly assisted us as we worked through the process. You were part of the team and a valued member at that." John Collins, Former CFO and Acting CEO, Citywide.</p>
