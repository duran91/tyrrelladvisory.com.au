    <h1 class="medium-heading">Indicative Valuations</h1>
    <p>Valuation is relevant to every transaction, whether you are selling, buying or merging. It is also so much more
      than a pure mathematical calculation.
    </p>
    <p>Whatever the reason for the valuation, it is imperative that a commercial mindset be adopted to understand the
      business, how it operates, its strengths and weaknesses, and the industry landscape in which it operates.
    </p>
    <p>Tyrrell Advisory understands the importance of valuation to every engagement it undertakes and the impact it has
      for our clients in making key strategic decisions.
