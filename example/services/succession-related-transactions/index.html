    <h1 class="long-heading">Succession Related Transactions</h1>
    <p>An increasing number of private businesses are facing succession challenges, particularly where there is a desire
      from the founder’s next generation to acquire part or all of the business. Tyrrell Advisory works with all family
      members to develop a plan enabling the staged buy-out of the founder’s equity.
    </p>
    <p>Similarly, we can advise parties in instances where management teams may be seeking to implement a Management
      Buy-Out
      (MBO) or Management Buy-In (MBI) of a business.</p>
    <p>In each of the above transactions, Tyrrell Advisory can provide the following services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deal structuring and transaction management</li>
      <li>Valuing the business</li>
      <li>Working together with the various stakeholders</li>
      <li>Co-ordinate with other advisors and financiers</li>
      <li>Document the transaction</li>
      <li>Close the transaction</li>
    </ul>
