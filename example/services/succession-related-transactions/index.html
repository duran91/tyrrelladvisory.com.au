    <h1 class="long-heading">Succession Related Transactions</h1>
    <p>An increasing number of private businesses are facing succession challenges, particularly where there is a desire
      from the founder’s next generation to acquire part or all of the business. Tyrrell Advisory works with all family
      members to develop a plan enabling the staged buy-out of the founder’s equity.
    </p>
    <p>Similarly, we can advise parties in instances where management teams may be seeking to implement a Management
      Buy-Out
      (MBO) or Management Buy-In (MBI) of a business.</p>
    <p>In each of the above transactions, Tyrrell Advisory can provide the following services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deal structuring and transaction management</li>
      <li>Valuing the business</li>
      <li>Working together with the various stakeholders</li>
      <li>Co-ordinate with other advisors and financiers</li>
      <li>Document the transaction</li>
      <li>Close the transaction</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="deal-title">Advised Perry's Shareholders</p>
        <p class="deal-content">We successfully advised the shareholders of this regional $130 million revenue fuel retailing and distribution business on finalising a very complex and time consuming transaction between shareholders, in conjunction with exploring interest from third parties.</p>
        <p class="deal-content recommendation">“A good friend of mine introduced me to David Tyrrell – he had some previous dealings with David and was very impressed by his professionalism and passed comment that if he was going to exit, he would approach David to handle the engagement. After having finalised our transaction, I can only echo these comments. David was a pleasure to work with through the process. The ultimate professional all the way dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s. We were informed of the process and costs from the start and the process was followed exactly. I would have no hesitation in recommending David to any of my former associates in the oil industry that wish to exit.” Rob Perry, Director and Shareholder, LH Perry & Sons.</p>
