<div class="about-us-content">
  <div class="container">
    <p>David is an M&A specialist with a strong track record from over 25 yearsâ€™ experience advising clients (mainly
      private business owners) and managing transactions across a broad range of industries and jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>We are relationship-focused and provide owners of private businesses with superior quality and objective
      financial and strategic advice in relation to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Divestments of businesses and non-core activities</li>
      <li>Acquisitions of businesses</li>
      <li>Mergers, joint ventures and strategic alliances</li>
      <li>Indicative valuations</li>
      <li>Private capital raisings</li>
      <li>Other succession related transactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With our understanding of the dynamics driving the current market, our extensive international and domestic
      transaction execution experience and wide range of networks and contacts, we aim to provide our clients with a
      quality advisory and solution-driven approach. We manage the transaction through the entire project and work
      closely with our clients to add value and achieve the best possible result.</p>
    <p>Equally, we appreciate the planning that is required to prepare for such transactions, in particular divestments.
      Indeed, businesses may not always be ready for sale and in these instances we will be pleased to work with owners
      on an ongoing basis over two to three years to drive an agreed agenda to effect change that improves the business
      and makes it transaction ready.</p>
    <p>Opportunities can often present themselves unexpectedly from left-field. Tyrrell Advisory works with our clients
      to plan and co-ordinate responses to such scenarios.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, as part of its wide range of networks, Tyrrell Advisory works closely with many other advisors and
      investors, including accounting and tax firms, legal practices and private equity firms. This provides us with
      direct access and established relationships with key personnel of these firms.</p>
