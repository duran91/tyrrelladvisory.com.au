    <h1>Approach & Philosophy</h1>
    <p>In establishing Tyrrell Advisory, we are, and remain, very clear on three key ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The absolute importance of establishing a trusted relationship with our clients and being available for our
        clients at
        all times;</li>
      <li>The provision of quality and timely advice; and</li>
      <li>Conducting ourselves with integrity at all times.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing is more pleasing than helping our clients achieve, or over-achieve, their expectations. Our clients’
      success is
      our main driver and motivates our solution-driven approach to our work.</p>
    <p>We are a strong believer in the role that people and leadership issues have in the success of any business and,
      by
      association, any M&A transaction undertaken by owners, particularly private business owners. We understand the
      importance and sensitivities associated with leadership issues and having the right personnel to both manage the
      day to
      day operations of the business and drive corporate strategy and associated M&A transactions.</p>

      day to day operations of the business and drive corporate strategy and associated M&A transactions.</p>
    <p>The provision of the highest quality advice is something to which we are equally dedicated. We will always be
      honest, clear, commercial and practical with our advice and analysis. Furthermore, we undertake to be pro-active,
      resourceful and responsive and will always be committed to excellence. By adopting this professional approach it
      in turn allows our clients to make informed and timely decisions.</p>
    <p>Finally, integrity is key to both our behaviour and how Tyrrell Advisory is seen in the market place. We are
      truly independent and do not undertake any broking, underwriting, fund management activities, lending or financial
      products advice – thus avoiding conflicting interests that can be associated with larger advisory firms and
      financial institutions. We also understand and appreciate the sensitivities associated with confidentiality during
      such processes, whether it be dealing with customers, suppliers and employees or the staged release of
      confidential information.</p>
