    <p>This policy describes the way Tyrrell Advisory collects, uses and discloses your personal information and your
      rights in relation to our management of your personal information.</p>
    <p class="sub-heading">Collection Personal Information</p>
    <p>Generally, we collect your personal information from you. There may be occasions when we collect your personal
      information from other sources such as from an information service provider or a publicly maintained record.</p>
    <p>Personal information is information that identifies an individual. During the provision of our services, we may
      collect your personal information. Generally, the kinds of personal information we collect are your name, address,
      telephone number, e-mail address and personal information contained in the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>financial documents;</li>
      <li>documents relating to your investments; and</li>
      <li>any other personal document you provide to us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A failure to provide your personal information may affect our ability to assist you.</p>
    <p class="sub-heading">USING AND DISCLOSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
    <p>We disclose your personal information for the purposes for which we collect it. That is, to provide financial
      services to you. In providing our services, we may disclose your information to third parties that we engage to
      perform administrative or other services. Such disclosure is always on a confidential basis.</p>
    <p>We may also use and disclose personal information for other purposes where we have consent or in certain other
      circumstances in accordance with the Privacy Act, for example where the use and disclosure is authorised by law or
      is necessary as part of an investigation into unlawful activity.</p>
    <p>We may use information to contact clients and other parties who have provided us their personal information to
      promote other services we offer and events and publications that may be relevant. Individuals can opt out of
      receiving offers and promotions from Tyrrell Advisory by request.</p>

    <p class="sub-heading">ACCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
    <p>Individuals may request access to their personal information held by Tyrrell Advisory on request, unless access
      is restricted under the Privacy Act, for example if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>giving access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of others; or</li>
      <li>the information would prejudice negotiations we are having with you; or</li>
      <li>giving access would be unlawful</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If Tyrrell Advisory declines to provide access to the personal information it holds, it will provide reason(s)
      why to the extent this is permitted or practicable.</p>
